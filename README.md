### The problem

DALL·E 2 is an incredible system. It displays creativity never before seen in a ML system. The only problem is that the UI only lets you view the 50 most recent prompts and generated image sets. Anything more than 50 tasks ago is lost. Currently if you want to save the images you have to download each image one by one, and if you want to remember which prompt generated these images you have to make a note of that yourself, and how to link which prompts generated which images becomes an annoying exercise in manual organisation and a lot of file naming.

### The solution

This extension creates a button in the bottom left hand corner that, when clicked, downloads all of 6 currently shown images in a zip folder, whose filename is the prompt that generated them. You can now save your prompt and its generated images in a single click.

Adds a button to the DALL·E 2 web app that lets you download generated images along with the prompt that generated them.

## What does it do

When you click the button it will download a zip folder containing all the generated images for the currently viewed prompt. The filename of the zip folder will be the prompt that generated the images.

## Known limitations

If the prompt's input field has been edited after generating the images or after navigating back to a previous task, the zip folder name will take that edited version of the prompt instead of the original one that was actually used to generate the images.

Unfortunately the page HTML contains no other reference to the prompt that generated the images. The page title was an option, but it doesn't update when you navigate to a previously generated prompt. So the prompt input field is the best we can do.
